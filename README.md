Predict Medicine Dosage
This repository contains the code and notebook for predicting medicine dosage for a patient. The Jupyter notebook "Patient_3.ipynb" is designed to be used with Python 3, and it uses machine learning techniques to predict the optimal dosage of medicine for a particular patient based on various input parameters.

Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:

Patient_3.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the medicine dosage prediction. It includes the data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation. The notebook is well-documented with comments to explain the different steps and sections of the code.

README.md: This is the README file that provides documentation and instructions on how to use the code in this repository.

Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sajinpgupta/Predict_Medicine_Dosage.git
Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned and open the "Patient_3.ipynb" notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. If not, you can install them using the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and make predictions for medicine dosage.

Customize the input parameters in the notebook to make predictions for different patients or scenarios. You can also modify the model hyperparameters, data preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics as needed.

Review the notebook outputs and interpretation of the results to understand the predicted medicine dosage for the patient based on the input parameters.

Data
The "Patient_3.ipynb" notebook uses a dataset containing patient information, such as age, weight, height, and other relevant parameters, to predict the optimal medicine dosage. The dataset used in this notebook is not included in the repository, and it is assumed that you will provide your own data for training and prediction purposes.

License
This repository is licensed under the MIT License, which means that you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for any purpose. However, please note that the dataset used in this notebook may have its own license, and you should ensure compliance with any applicable data usage guidelines.
